### FAQ

##### How to avoid manually importing GPG keys?

It's recommended to control the keys manually. However if you know what you doing, `keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve` GPG option will automatically import GPG keys.

#### Translations

To start working on a new language, say 'es' (Spanish), add it to the
`Makefile` `LANGS` variable and run `make`. Then translate `locale/es.po` using
your favorite PO editor. Run `make` every time the Python code strings change
or the `.po` is modified.

Once done, don't forget to distribute the new language by adding it to the
`PKGBUILD` `package()`.
